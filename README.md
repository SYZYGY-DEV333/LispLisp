# LispLisp
Objectively the best esoteric language ever

Here's Version 2: Now compiles to LazyK. I included a couple of somewhat-modified LazyK interpreters, along with a Bash script
to automate the interpretation process. The version in C (originally by irori) is much faster than the Haskell one (by dforgeas).
Both of the above, incidentally, are licensed under GPL version 2. I intend to write my own interpreter in Scheme at some point,
under my preferred Apache license. Until then, however, note that the lazyk.hs and lazyk.c files are GPL version 2, and the rest
of the stuff is Apache.

Have fun.
